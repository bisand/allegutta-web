## ATH (All-Time High) Functionality Validation Report

### ðŸŽ¯ **VALIDATION RESULT: âœ… WORKING CORRECTLY**

### Tests Performed:
1. **Enhanced Portfolio API** (`/api/portfolios/{id}/enhanced`)
   - âœ… Successfully fetches ATH data
   - âœ… Updates ATH when current value exceeds previous high
   - âœ… Calculates ATH drawdown and days since ATH

2. **Holdings Recalculation API** (`/api/portfolios/{id}/recalculate-holdings`)
   - âœ… Successfully recalculates holdings
   - âœ… Updates ATH during recalculation process
   - âœ… Processes all portfolio securities

### Current ATH Status:
- **Portfolio ID**: cmf509i4v0001l1vwdqodf07q (AlleGutta)
- **Current ATH Value**: 1,940,955.04 NOK
- **ATH Date**: September 8, 2025 07:30:43 UTC
- **ATH Drawdown**: 0.18% (very close to ATH)
- **Days Since ATH**: 0 (today!)
- **Is at ATH**: No (but very close)

### Key Improvements Made:

#### 1. **Fixed Missing ATH Updates**
- **Problem**: ATH tracker existed but was never called during normal operations
- **Solution**: Added `updatePortfolioAth()` calls to both enhanced API and recalculation API

#### 2. **Enhanced API Updates** (`/api/portfolios/[id]/enhanced.get.ts`)
- Now imports and uses `updatePortfolioAth` function
- Updates ATH whenever portfolio value is calculated
- Uses updated ATH values in response

#### 3. **Recalculation API Updates** (`/api/portfolios/[id]/recalculate-holdings.post.ts`)
- Now imports and uses `updatePortfolioAth` function
- Calculates total portfolio value after recalculation
- Updates ATH if current value exceeds previous high
- Logs ATH updates with console messages

### How ATH Updates Work:

1. **Automatic Updates**: ATH is checked and updated every time:
   - Enhanced portfolio data is fetched
   - Holdings are recalculated
   - Portfolio value is calculated

2. **ATH Calculation**: 
   - Market value (holdings Ã— current prices) + cash balance
   - Compared against previous ATH value
   - Updated if current value exceeds previous high

3. **ATH History**: Previous ATH values are stored in `ath_history` table

### Production Deployment:
The ATH functionality is now active and will:
- âœ… Update automatically when portfolios are viewed
- âœ… Update when holdings are recalculated  
- âœ… Track historical ATH values
- âœ… Show real-time ATH status and drawdowns

### Next Steps:
No further action required. The ATH functionality is working as intended and will automatically update in production when portfolio values exceed previous highs.
